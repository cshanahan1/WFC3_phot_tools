    """Calculates flux errors in the same manner as IRAF/DAOphot. 

    The error terms in this model represent Poisson noise from the source, 
    Poisson noise in the sky and readout noise, and error in the sky measurement

    phot_ap_area**2 * backrms**2 / sky_ap_area)
    Where flux is the aperture sum, back is the per-pixel background level,
    epadu is the conversion factor between e- and adu (gain), phot_ap_area is
    the area of the photometric aperture, backrms is the uncertainty in the sky,
    and sky_ap_area is the sky aperture area. Note that the flux/background
    in the above equation are in ADU, but the input to this function is in e-.
    The conversion is done internally.
    Parameters
    ----------
    flux : float
        Non-sky subtracted flux of star, in electrons.
    back : float
        Per-pixel background level.
    back_rms : float
        Background RMS.
    phot_ap_area : int or float
        Area of photometric aperture.
    sky_ap_area : int or float
        Area of sky aperture.
    gain : float
        CCD gain, default 1.0.
     Returns
     --------
     errs : tuple
        (error in insturmental magnitudes, error in flux)
